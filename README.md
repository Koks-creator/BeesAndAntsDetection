# BeesAndAntsDetection
My further experiments with sahi - same bs like in but this time we are detecting bees and ants https://github.com/Koks-creator/DamagedRoadSystem with minor changes in code.
Thr goal was to once again compare yolov11 regular vs sahi in smaller objects because regular yolo can struggle sometimes. 
<br>
<br>
**Conclusion:** yolo with sahi is usually better in detecting smaller objects but is slower (at least on cpu), other problem in this project is my SORT algorithm struggles to track small objects that's why caunting is kinda fucked ngl.
